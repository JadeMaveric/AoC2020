# AoC2020
These are my solutions to AdventOfCode-2020, an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels.

Most problems (so far) have been very straighforward, with a few moderately challenging ones thrown in to bamboozle the inexperienced coder.
My personal goal solving these is improve how fast I can come up with solutions, without resorting to spaghetti code, or an otherwise rigid solution.

So far (day 11), I havn't had to use any dependencies other than python. I've also included inputs (both the demo, and my personal one) to the questions so you test the programs yourself.
I hope you lovely advent, and a meaningful Christmas! Cheers :D
